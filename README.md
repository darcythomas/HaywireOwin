Owin (http://owin.org/) implementation on top of the Haywire HTTP server (https://github.com/kellabyte/Haywire)


Currently very expermental.
Just proving technologies (in the C# side) at this stage

Implement the full Owin 1.0 specification.
Pass all Owin 1.0 specification unit test

#####Performance:
Will only add a 20% overhead above the haywire benchmarks

#####Cross platform:
Will work cross platform (*nix win osx)


#####Simple to use:
Painless deployment / instalation etc
